<p>
Cloud Vision API allows developers to easily integrate vision detection features within applications, including image labeling, face and landmark detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and tagging of explicit content.
</p>
<p>
In this code, you'll use the Google Vision API to detect faces in an image and webcam.js. To prove to yourself that the faces were detected correctly, you'll then use that data to draw a box around each face.
